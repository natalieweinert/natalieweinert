Full Depth Software Engineer
----------------------------

A dedicated professional with \*\*almost 2 decades\*\* in technology and software engineering. 
I love art and form and various creative developments of humanity and how we perceive and express the world around of us. 
In another life i would pursued architecture, classical music, fashion, modeling, dance, acting, or something in the arts. 
Unfortunately those talents were so far removed my natural abilities that they exist only in my mind and the rare moments i find myself truely alone.
I began my journey in technology as an outlet for artistic creativity to round out my overly analytical mind. 
My career has been driven by a deep-seated passion for leveraging tech to enhance the way we create, live, learn, work, play, and connect. 
I aspire for my solutions to approach artistry with elegance and simiplicity with a respect for efficiency and maintainability. 

I have a strong admiration for the technology we already stand upon, and a forward-thinking attitude towards making existing things better and turning new ideas into new realities. 
I have gained a wide and deep set of skills developing applications, from my entry co-developed chat program coded in FoxPro in 1996 to full-scale enterprise line-of-business applications. 
In the process, I have gained a lot of knowledge in many business sectors, including retail, banking, online platforms (food ordering), dealership management, and others along the way. 
Covering a broad set of areas from general ledger, accounts payable, human resources, taxes, credit card processing, security, and many more. 
The beauty of technology is that it has a place almost anywhere you can imagine it. 
In the process, you will find yourself not just learning technology and business but also the diverse impact you can have on people‚Äôs lives.

I‚Äôm always experimenting with new technology stacks to see how they can improve lives and to entertain my mind. 
As a neurodivergent person, I struggle to stay focused on any one thing, and you‚Äôll find my hand in every cookie jar. 
The first half of my career was spent developing and enhancing large-scale z/OS applications in tandem with sideline .Net and, occasionally, Java (WebSphere) augmenting applications. 
In the last decade, .Net has become my daily industry driver, with an interest in Node.js and various web development stacks as businesses look to modernize and improve access to their existing stacks. 
I‚Äôm not a believer in one-size-fits-all solutions in any aspect of life, and as such, I believe a software engineer should always be learning and growing their crafts. 
I consider myself a lifelong learner in technology and many other areas that intersect with my life.

I believe that technology is most powerful when it helps us live in the moment and connect more meaningfully with the world around us. 
When technology isn‚Äôt the thing in the way but out of the way, I‚Äôm an increasingly avid supporter of finding a happy medium with screen usage. 
I don‚Äôt believe in the ‚Äòput away for the day‚Äô attitude, but I do think that technology should augment us, not absorb our every minute. 
We have to learn to co-exist with technology to empower us to connect with each other in the living world, not behind the screen. 
When I step away from the screen, you‚Äôll find me first and foremost having fun with my toddler (dancing and reading children‚Äôs books). 
I‚Äôm an aspiring neurodivergent mom to a non-verbal, neurodivergent toddler with superpowers in patience and compassion. 
You‚Äôve been warned: we are a force to be reckoned with and won‚Äôt be stopped. 
When time allows, you‚Äôll find me dabbling in various interests.
